        <p>My research has investigated feedback and control systems from technical, scientific, and social aspects.
        </p>
        <p>By my high-school graduation, I had published research in the UT Austin <a href="http://chaos.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Non-Linear Dynamics</a> dealing with metastable fluid states in both uniform and gradient density flows. While at UC Berkeley, I developed optimized control systems with NAO humanoid robots, self-driving cars, and autonomous quadcopters. I feel extremely privileged to have been part of the <a href="http://citris-uc.org/initiatives/robotics-2/" target="_blank">CITRIS People and Robots lab</a> to design more life-like human-robot interactions. I previously worked at Sonyâ€™s Human-Computer Interaction lab as a user experience designer to create prototypes for interactive home and car environments. Our team created revolutionary interfaces for collaborative computing, connected devices, and ambient feedback. I currently work at San Francisco startup <a href="http://mesosphere.com" target="_blank">Mesosphere</a> to design large-scale distributed self-healing infrastructure, for which I am leading an internet-of-things initiative to allow real-time data to flow through millions of sensors. In my spare time, I like to play with small-scale feedback systems such as my closed-loop aquaponics garden. I am an avid visual artist and I have created large-scale public installations. I am also a public speaker who has been funded to travel and speak about issues of social computing and civic engagement. Rather than see these interests as divergent, I feel that they contribute to an overall understanding of the various potential contexts for addressing human needs with creative computing.
